# SimpleDiffusion: A Simple Diffusion Model

SimpleDiffusion is a basic diffusion model trained on approximately **150,000 image-text pairs** from image forums across the internet.

This model was trained on about 30 epochs over a two month period. I don't have access to amazing gpus as I'm just one person, but the model shows promise if trained further.

The model is roughly **831 million** parameters, and is trained at 256x256.
